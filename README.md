## Overview

The Steam Cover Maker project was born out of the desire to enhance the visual appeal of non-Steam games added to the Steam library. Recognizing the need for a tool that could facilitate the creation of more engaging and visually appealing covers, this project was initiated. This tool aims to offer a simple and intuitive solution for gamers looking to personalize their library with better covers, thereby improving the overall user experience. We invite everyone to use and contribute to this project, potentially making it a staple in the customization of Steam libraries worldwide.
